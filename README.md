In the pursuit of the Google Advanced Data Analytics certification, I have chosen to work on the TikTok project. <br><br>
Background:<br> 
TikTok users have the ability to submit reports that identify videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. The process generates a large number of user reports that are challenging to consider in a timely manner. As such, TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently. <br>With this final product of building a prediction model in mind, the guided projects are completed in the following order:
1) [Course 2 lab, data analysis with Pandas]https://github.com/ZhengLonggg/Google-Advanced-Data-Analytics-Projects/blob/main/Course%202%20lab%2C%20data%20analysis%20with%20Pandas.ipynb <br>
This is the first project that I completed for my Google Advanced Data Analytics course.  In this fictional case study, I analyzed a synthetic TikTok dataset. Each TikTok video, represented as a row in the dataset, is mainly classified as either a 'claim' or an 'opinion'. TikTok videos are classified as 'claim' when the TikTok content creator asserts a statement as fact or presents information that can be objectively verified. On the other hand, TikTok videos that are classified as 'opinion' are those where TikTok content creators are expressing their feelings or views.  
The project objectives include:<br>
• Building a dataframe for the TikTok dataset<br>
• Gathering descriptive statistics<br>
• Visualizing the TikTok data in Python<br>
• Using pandas to manipulate the data for analysis and visualization<br>
