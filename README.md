In the pursuit of the Google Advanced Data Analytics certification, I have chosen to work on the TikTok project. The synthetic TikTok data can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BTVomLOrzNRGtF4QGTwf86eVm5gOpwpE4Ai_F1NAHbo/template/preview?resourcekey=0-OGt7Jh_Vj5AcZaxwYvegpA)<br><br>
Background:<br> 
TikTok users have the ability to submit reports that identify videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. The process generates a large number of user reports that are challenging to consider timely. As such, TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently. <br>With this final product of building a prediction model in mind, the guided projects are completed in the following order:
1) [Course 2 lab, data analysis with Pandas](https://github.com/ZhengLonggg/Google-Advanced-Data-Analytics-Projects/blob/main/Course%202%20lab%2C%20data%20analysis%20with%20Pandas.ipynb) <br>
This is the first project that I completed for my Google Advanced Data Analytics course.  In this fictional case study, I analyzed a synthetic TikTok dataset. Each TikTok video, where its data is represented as a row in the dataset, is mainly classified as either a 'claim' or an 'opinion'. TikTok videos are classified as 'claim' when the TikTok content creator asserts a statement as fact or presents information that can be objectively verified. On the other hand, TikTok videos that are classified as 'opinion' are those where TikTok content creators are expressing their feelings or views.  
This lab objectives include:<br>
• Building a dataframe for the TikTok dataset.<br>
• Gathering descriptive statistics.<br>
• Visualizing the TikTok data in Python.<br>
• Using pandas to manipulate the data for analysis and visualisation.<br><br>
2) [Course 3 lab, EDA with Python](https://github.com/ZhengLonggg/Google-Advanced-Data-Analytics-Projects/blob/main/Course%203%20lab%2C%20EDA.ipynb) <br>
In the second guided project, I focused on exploratory data analysis (EDA) with the TikTok dataset. I practiced uncovering patterns by presenting findings through boxplots, histograms, barplots, piecharts, and scatterplots. These visualisations has helped me to explore and compare the relationships between different variables, such as the viewing proportion of TikTok videos classified as 'claim' against those classified as 'opinion'. <br>
This lab objectives include:<br>
• Exploring and cleaning the TikTok dataset.<br>
• Performing EDA. <br>
• Data visualisation with various charts. <br>
• Determine outliers. <br><br>
3) [Course 4 lab, hypothesis testing with Python](https://github.com/ZhengLonggg/Google-Advanced-Data-Analytics-Projects/blob/main/Course%204%20lab%2C%20Hypothesis%20Testing.ipynb)  <br>
Next, we investigate the relationship between TikTok authors' verification status and their average video view counts. Specifically, do verified authors command higher average view counts, or are the view counts simmilar between verified and unverified authors? To answer this, we use hypothesis testing. <br>
This lab objectives include:<br>
• Dropping rows with null values. <br>
• Using hypothesis testing to determine if there's a significant difference in the view count for verified vs unverified authors. <br>
• Posing potential follow-up questions based on the findings. <br><br>
3) [Course 5 lab, Regression Modeling](https://github.com/ZhengLonggg/Google-Advanced-Data-Analytics-Projects/blob/main/Course%205%20lab%2C%20Regression%20Modeling.ipynb)  <br>
In this project, I built a regression model in Python to predict whether a TikTok account is verified based on certain video characteristics, such as the duration of the TikTok video and its view count. <br>
This lab objectives include:<br>
• Encoding categorical variables for regression compatibility. <br>
• Building a logistic regression model to predict account verification status. <br>
• Visualising the model performance using confusion matrix. <br>
• Interpretting model coefficients to identify key predictors. <br>
• Evaluating model performance using classification report and metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. <br><br>
